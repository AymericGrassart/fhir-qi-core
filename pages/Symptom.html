<p>This QDM to QI Core Mapping for the QDM Datatype &#34;Symptom&#34; was reviewed by the CQI WG on March 30, 2018 based on QDM version 5.3. There is no change in the structure of &#34;Symptom&#34; in QDM version 5.4. QDM version 5.4 includes the guidance, &#34;Note that while many symptoms are entered as findings as part of assessments and, therefore, may not be included in a specific EHR “symptom” section, QDM 5.4 retains the QDM datatype, Symptom, for clarity of expression in the human readable eCQM.&#34;</p>
<p>
    QDM defines “symptom” as an indication that a person has a condition or disease.
    Some examples include headache, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and pain.
    Also, symptoms are subjective manifestations of the disease perceived by the patient.
    As an example to differentiate symptom from finding, the patient’s subjective symptom of fever is distinguished from the temperature (a finding).
    For a finding, there is either a source of either a temperature-measuring device together with a recorder of the device (electronically) or an individual (healthcare provider, patient, etc.).
</p>
<p>Note: Definitions regarding symptom on the FHIR condition resource Boundaries and Relationships (Section 9.2.2: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/condition.html">http://hl7.org/fhir/condition.html</a>):</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        [The Condition] resource is not typically used to record information about subjective and objective information that might lead to the recording of a Condition resource. Such signs and symptoms are typically captured using the&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html">Observation</a> resource; although in some cases a persistent symptom, e.g. fever, headache may be captured as a condition before a definitive diagnosis can be discerned by a clinician. By contrast, headache may be captured as an Observation when it contributes to the establishment of a meningitis Condition.
    </li>
    <li>Use the&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/observation.html">Observation</a> resource when a symptom is resolved without long term management, tracking, or when a symptom contributes to the establishment of a condition.</li>
    <li>
        Use Condition when a symptom requires long term management, tracking, or is used as a proxy for a diagnosis or problem that is not yet determined.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the FHIR referenced provided above, the QDM <em>datatype </em>Symptom maps to the FHIR Observation resource.</p>
