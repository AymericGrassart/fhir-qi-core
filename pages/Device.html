<p>This QDM to QI Core Mapping for the QDM Datatype &#34;Device&#34; was reviewed by the CQI WG on April 6, 2018 for QDM version 5.3. The content presented here is based on QDM version 5.4 and removes the QDM 5.3 attribute &#34;anatomical approach site&#34; as there was no existing use or clear use case to retain it. </p>
<p>QDM defines Device as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in-vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and not dependent on being metabolized to achieve any of its primary intended purposes.   QDM provides three contexts for expressing devices: Device, Applied; Device, Order; and Device, Recommended.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Note that the current use of the QDM datatype “Device, Applied” usually references the procedure to “apply” the device (i.e., to use for the patient, to use on the patient’s body, or to implant in the patient’s body). Each of these current uses should address the concept using the QDM datatypes, Intervention, Performed, or Procedure, Performed.  </li>
<li>The original intent of the QDM datatype “Device, Applied” was to reference the specific device or type of device of concern to the measure. And that reference might be as detailed a providing a device class as referenced in a Unique Device Identifier (UDI). The FHIR Device resource (<a class="external free" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/device.html" rel="nofollow">http://hl7.org/fhir/device.html</a>) does have a metadata element for UDI (<a class="external free" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/device-definitions.html#Device.udi" rel="nofollow">http://hl7.org/fhir/device-definitions.html#Device.udi</a>). All device metadata reference inherent qualities of the device. And timing addresses Device.manufactureDate and Device.expirationDate. Therefore, a direct map to the Device resource may not be sufficient or appropriate for the QDM Device, Applied datatype.</li>
<li>The FHIR Resource DeviceUseStatement (<a class="external free" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/deviceusestatement.html" rel="nofollow">http://hl7.org/fhir/deviceusestatement.html</a>) is a more appropriate resource to map QDM Device, Applied. The DeviceUseStatement has a maturity level of 0, so the mapping will need to be updated as the resource is updated. Note: this mapping will need to be reviewed with the QI Core DeviceUseStatement to assure alignment since the current QI Core content does not seem to address the most recent version of DeviceUseStatement.</li>
