<p>The FHIR R4 and the QI-Core DeviceRequest profile describes the request to use of a device by a patient.  The device 
may be any pertinent device specified in the Device resource. Examples of devices that may be requested include a
wheelchair, hearing aids, or an insulin pump. The request may lead to the dispensing of the device to the patient 
or for use by the patient. Orders or recommendations for use of a device for a patient use the ServiceRequest resource.</p>
<p>To create an expression specifically requesting information that a DeviceRequest intentionally did not occur for a 
medical, patient or system reason, use the profile <a href="StructureDefinition-qicore-devicenotrequested.html">QICore-Devicenotrequested</a>.</p>
