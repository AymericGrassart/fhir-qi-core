<p>
    The CMS Quality Data Model (QDM) has been used to express electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) in HQMF since 2012.
    QDM is a conceptual data model that has evolved based on feedback, testing and use.
    The current version (5.3) and QDM's complete history can be found on the <a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm">eCQI Resource Center</a>.
    Most of the QDM concepts map directly to FHIR resources and extensions represented in QI Core.
</p>

<p>
    This version of QI Core includes mappings from QI Core to QDM.
    Reviewers can evaluate the comparisons, represented in the <em>Mappings</em> table for each QI Core resource.
    Each <em>mapping</em> table shows the QI Core concept in the left-hand column and the corresponding QDM datatype(s) and attributes in the left-hand column.
    Only QI Core metadata concepts represented in QDM are included in the <em>mapping</em> tables.
    The effort mapped the intended meaning of each QDM datatype and attribute to a QI Core resource metadata element.
    In some cases, multiple QDM datatypes map to a single QI Core resource as indicated in the QI Core <em>mapping</em> table.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the QI Core to QDM comparisons presented with each QI Core resource, this section of the implementation guide presents the mapping directly from QDM concepts.
    Thus, the IG provides a view of the mappings in both directions (QI Core to QDM, and QDM to QI Core).
    This section is divided into 55 sections, one for each QDM concept, or QDM datatype.
    Each QDM datatype includes a general description of the concept and a table mapping each of the QDM datatype-related attributes to QI Core metadata elements.
    Refer to the <a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm">eCQI Resource Center</a> for the full QDM 5.3 documentation.

    QDM defines Adverse Event as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the clinical care delivery, whether or not considered drug related.

            A QDM date element binds the Adverse Event datatype to a value set (or to a direct reference code) indicating the suspect entity that might have caused the event.
            The reason is the measures have mostly been focused on Adverse Event as an exclusion criterion.
            Thus the "code" attribute is most consistent with AdverseEvent.suspectEntity.instance rather than the type of reaction.

        <td>AdverseEvent.reaction</td>

            The QDM "Type" attribute definition addresses a value set (or a direct referenced code) that describes the reaction.
            Hence the mapping of QDM "type" to AdverseEvent.reaction in QI Core. Example - anaphylactic reaction, hives, etc.
            Greater clarity in definition in QDM descriptions in the CQL-based HQMF and in the QDM publication should be helpful.
            In the future, QDM might consider adding the FHIR concept AdverseEvent.type (incident, near-miss, unsafe condition) and AdverseEvent.category (AE - adverse event Vs PAE - Potential Adverse Event)

        <em>Allergy</em> is used to address immune-mediated reactions to a substance such as type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, other allergy-like reactions, including pseudo-allergy.
        <em>Intolerance</em> is a record of a clinical assessment of a propensity, or a potential risk to an individual, to have a non-immune mediated adverse reaction on future exposure to the specified substance, or class of substance.

            It seems that the QDM Prevalence Period start should map to AllergyIntolerance.onset[x] and the Prevalence Period end should map to allergyintolerance-resolutionAge, but the age is an extension (i.e., QI Core only) and implementers would potentially need to map an age to a year and default a month and day.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Assessment</em> as a resource used to define specific observations that clinicians use to guide treatment of the patient.
    An assessment can be a single question, or observable entity with an expected response, an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals, or a single observable entity that is part of such a collection of questions.
    QDM further defines contexts for assessments: Assessment, Performed and Assessment, Recommended.
    Each context is mapped to QI Core elements in the following tables.

                Consider: Assessment to determine tobacco use history might ask for when tobacco use started and when it ended.
                The start time and stop time could be represented as answers to two different questions (i.e., when did the patient start and when did the patient end tobacco use).
                The Observation.effective[x] would apply more directly to a laboratory test the included collection of a specimen over a period of time.
            </p>
            Consider authorDatetime for Assessment, Performed is the dateTime the assessment is captured.

        <td>
            QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission.
            Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction.
            Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations.
            <p>
                Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale).
                This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument.
            </p>
            QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.
            A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation.
            The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Care Goal</em> as a defined target or measure to be achieved in the process of patient care, that is, an expected outcome.
    A typical goal is expressed as a change in status expected at a defined future time.
    That change can be an observation represented by other QDM categories (diagnostic tests, laboratory tests, symptoms, etc.) scheduled for some time in the future and with a particular value.
    A goal can be found in the plan of care (care plan), the structure used by all stakeholders, including the patient, to define the management actions for the various conditions, problems, or issues identified for the target of the plan.
    This structure, through which the goals and care-planning actions and processes can be organized, planned, communicated, and checked for completion, is represented in the QDM categories as a Record Artifact.
    A time/date stamp is required.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Communication</em> as the transmission, receipt, or acknowledgement of information sent from a source to a recipient, such as from one clinician to another regarding findings, assessments, plans of care, consultative advice, instructions, educational resources, etc.
    It also may include the receipt of response from a patient with respect to any aspect of the care provided.
    Furthermore, it may include the conveying of information from provider to patient (e.g., results, findings, plans for care, medical advice, instructions, educational resources, appointments).
    A time and date stamp is required.
    QDM defines three contexts for communication: Communication, Patient to Provider; Communication, Provider to Patient; Communication, Provider to Provider.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Condition/Diagnosis/Problem</em> as a practitioner's identification of a patient's disease, illness, injury, or condition.
    This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: <em>Diagnosis</em>.
    A practitioner determines the <em>diagnosis</em> by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history.
    <em>Diagnoses</em> are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient's plan of care (e.g., pregnancy).

    QDM defines <em>Device</em> as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in-vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and not dependent on being metabolized to achieve any of its primary intended purposes.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

            "Proposal" is most consistent with the ProcedureRequest when applied to clinical decision support (CDS) in which the CDS proposes an action to a provider or to a patient.
            The QDM concept Recommended addresses expectations a provider gives to a patient. Such recommendations are most consistent with the ProcedureRequest.intent value of "plan" (an intension to ensure something occurs without providing an authorization to act).

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Diagnostic Study</em> as any kind of medical test performed as a specific test or series of steps to aid in diagnosing or detecting disease (e.g., to establish a diagnosis, measure the progress or recovery from disease, confirm that a person is free from disease).<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
    The QDM defines diagnostic studies as those that are not performed in organizations that perform testing on samples of human blood, tissue, or other substance from the body.
    Diagnostic studies may make use of digital images and textual reports.
    Such studies include but are not limited to imaging studies, cardiology studies (electrocardiogram, treadmill stress testing), pulmonary-function testing, vascular laboratory testing, and others.
    QDM defines three contexts for Diagnostic Study: Diagnostic Study, Order; Diagnostic Study, Performed; and Diagnostic Study, Recommended.
    Note that QI Core maps for imaging type diagnostic studies are mapped to DiagnosticReport; QI Core maps for non-imaging type diagnostic studies are mapped to Observation.

            QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission.
            Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction.
            Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations.
            Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale).
            This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument.
            QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.
            A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation.
            The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Encounter</em> as an identifiable grouping of healthcare-related activities characterized by the entity relationship between the subject of care and a healthcare provider; such a grouping is determined by the healthcare provider.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
    A <em>patient encounter</em> represents interaction between a healthcare provider and a patient with a face-to-face patient visit to a clinician's office, or any electronically remote interaction with a clinician for any form of diagnostic treatment or therapeutic event.
    Encounters can be billable events but are not limited to billable interactions.
    Each encounter has an associated location or modality within which it occurred (such as an office, home, electronic methods, phone encounter, or telemedicine methods).
    The <em>encounter location</em> is the patient's location at the time of measurement.
    Different levels of interaction can be specified in the value associated with the element while modes of interaction (e.g., telephone) may be modeled using the data flow attribute.
    QDM defines three contexts for Encounter: Encounter, Order; Encounter, Performed; Encounter, Recommended.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Family History</em> as a diagnosis or problem experienced by a family member of the patient.
    Typically, a family history will not contain very much detail, but the simple identification of a diagnosis or problem in the patient's family history may be relevant to the care of the patient.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Individual Characteristic</em> as specific factors about a patient, clinician, provider, or facility.
    Included are demographics, behavioral factors, social or cultural factors, available resources, and preferences.
    <em>Behaviors</em> reference responses or actions that affect (either positively or negatively) health or healthcare.
    Included in this category are mental health issues, adherence issues unrelated to other factors or resources, coping ability, grief issues, and substance use/abuse.
    <em>Social/cultural factors</em> are characteristics of an individual related to family/caregiver support, education, and literacy (including health literacy), primary language, cultural beliefs (including health beliefs), persistent life stressors, spiritual and religious beliefs, immigration status, and history of abuse or neglect.
    <em>Resources</em> are means available to a patient to meet health and healthcare needs, which might include caregiver support, insurance coverage, financial resources, and community resources to which the patient is already connected and from which the patient is receiving benefit.
    <em>Preferences</em> are choices made by patients and their caregivers relative to options for care or treatment (including scheduling, care experience, and meeting of personal health goals) and the sharing and disclosure of their health information.
    <br />
    QDM defines nine individual characteristics: Patient Characteristic; Patient Characteristic, Birthdate; Patient Characteristic, Clinical Trial Participant; Patient Characteristic, Ethnicity; Patient Characteristic, Expired; Patient Characteristic, Payer; Patient Characteristic, Race; Patient Characteristic, Sex; Provider Characteristic.

            Procedure Request intent uses the concepts proposal, plan, order, original-order, reflex-order, filler-order, instance-order, option.
            "Proposal" is most consistent with the ProcedureRequest when applied to clinical decision support (CDS) in which the CDS proposes an action to a provider or to a patient.
            The QDM concept Recommended addresses expectations a provider gives to a patient.
            Such recommendations are most consistent with the ProcedureRequest.intent value of "plan" (an intension to ensure something occurs without providing an authorization to act).

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Laboratory Test</em> as a medical procedure that involves testing a sample of blood, urine, or other substance from the body.
    Tests can help determine a diagnosis, plan treatment, check to see if treatment is working, or monitor the disease over time. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
    This QDM data category for Laboratory Test is only used for information about the subject of record.
    QDM defines three contexts for Laboratory Test: Laboratory Test, Order; Laboratory Test, Performed; Laboratory Test, Recommended.

        <td>
            QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission.
            Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction.
            Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations.
            Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale).
            This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument.
            QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.
            A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation.
            The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Physical Exam</em> as the evaluation of the patient's body and/or mental status exam to determine its state of health.
    The techniques of examination can include palpation (feeling with the hands or fingers), percussion (tapping with the fingers), auscultation (listening), visual inspection or observation, inquisition and smell.
    Measurements may include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration) as well as other clinical measures (such as expiratory flow rate and size of lesion).
    Physical exam includes psychiatric examinations.
    QDM defines three contexts for Physical Exam: Physical Exam, Order; Physical Exam, Performed; Physical Exam, Recommended.

            QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission.
            Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction.
            Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations.
            Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale).
            This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument.
            QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.
            A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation.
            The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Procedure</em> as "An Act whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the subject. ... Procedure is but one among several types of clinical activities such as observation, substance-administrations, and communicative interactions ... Procedure does not comprise all acts of [sic] whose intent is intervention or treatment."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    A <em>procedure</em> may be a surgery or other type of physical manipulation of a person's body in whole or in part for purposes of making observations and diagnoses or providing treatment.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
    QDM defines three contexts for Procedure: Procedure, Order; Procedure, Performed; Procedure, Recommended.

            QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission.
            Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction.
            Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations.
            Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale).
            This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument.
            QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.
            A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation.
            The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code.

<p>
    QDM defines <em>Substance</em> as a homogeneous material with definite composition that includes allergens, biological materials, chemicals, foods, drugs and materials.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>
    QDM distinguishes between medications from non-medication substances by separately listing medication datatypes.
    Substance may or may not have a code or be classified by a code system such RxNorm.
    Examples of a substance may include environmental agents (e.g., pollen, dust) and food (e.g., vitamins).
    QDM defines three contexts for Substance: Substance, Administered; Substance, Order; Substance, Recommended.
    Since QDM addresses substance a something that is administered, ordered or recommended, the actions are analogous to medications.
    Hence, the QDM category Substance is mapped to QI core Medication concepts.

<p>
    QDM defines Symptom as an indication that a person has a condition or disease.
    Some examples are headache, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and pain.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>
    Also, symptoms are subjective manifestations of the disease perceived by the patient.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>
    As an example to differentiate symptom from finding, the patient’s subjective symptom of fever is distinguished from the temperature (a finding).
    For a finding, there is either a source of either a temperature-measuring device together with a recorder of the device (electronically) or an individual (healthcare provider, patient, etc.).
