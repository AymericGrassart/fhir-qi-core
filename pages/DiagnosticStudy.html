<p>The content on this page was updated on 6 April 2018 based on discussion on the CQI Workgroup Conference call on April 6, 2018.<br />
QDM defines Diagnostic Study as any kind of medical test performed as a specific test or series of steps to aid in diagnosing or detecting disease (e.g., to establish a diagnosis, measure the progress or recovery from disease, confirm that a person is free from disease).  The QDM defines diagnostic studies as those that are not performed in organizations that perform testing on samples of human blood, tissue, or other substance from the body. Diagnostic studies may make use of digital images and textual reports. Such studies include but are not limited to imaging studies, cardiology studies (electrocardiogram, treadmill stress testing), pulmonary-function testing, vascular laboratory testing, and others. QDM defines three contexts for Diagnostic Study: Diagnostic Study, Order; Diagnostic Study, Performed; and Diagnostic Study, Recommended. Note that QI Core maps for imaging type diagnostic studies are mapped to DiagnosticReport; QI Core maps for non-imaging type diagnostic studies are mapped to Observation.

<td>ProcedureRequest.intent</td>

<td>Procedure Request intent uses the concepts proposal, plan, order, original-order, reflex-order, filler-order, instance-order, option. &#34;Proposal&#34; is most consistent with the ProcedureRequest when applied to clinical decision support (CDS) in which the CDS proposes an action to a provider or to a patient. The QDM concept Recommended addresses expectations a provider gives to a patient. Such recommendations are most consistent with the ProcedureRequest.intent value of &#34;plan&#34; (an intension to ensure something occurs without providing an authorization to act).</td>

<td>Components</td>

<td>Observation.component</td>

<td>QDM uses components to combine related observations to each other, e.g., a set of independent observations performed within an admission assessment for an inpatient admission. Each observation is unique (e.g., questions about tobacco usage, other substance usage, blood pressure, pulse, skin turgor, etc., etc.) but they are captured during the same patient-provider interaction. Such QDM components should map directly to QI Core / FHIR observations that can be linked to other observations. Other QDM component examples include multiple questions that are part of a validated evaluation tool (e.g., a Braden skin assessment scale). This latter example indicates individual questions that are inherently tied to the Braden scale instrument and the questions and answers do not have inherent value without being part of the instrument. QI Core / FHIR considers each such question as an Observation.component.  A general rule of thumb is QI Core / FHIR components apply only when the inherent value of the observation is defined by the parent observation. The result is that the content will determine if a QDM component maps to Observation.code or to Observation.component.code. </td>
