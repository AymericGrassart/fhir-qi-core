STU Note: Mappings from the QI Core Profiles to Quality Data Model have been removed from this version of the QI Core IG. The CQI Work Group is seeking implementer feedback on the value of these mappings and whether they would be useful to include in a future version of the specification. Mappings from QDM-to-QI-Core are still available on the [QDM-to-QI-Core](qdm-to-qicore.html) page, and the FHIR-to-QDM mappings are still available in the mappings section for each profile in the [STU3.2 version](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore/STU32/) of this implementation guide.
