<p>This QDM to QI Core Mapping for the QDM Datatype &#34;Diagnosis&#34; was updated 3 April 2018 based on discussion in the CQI WG on March 30, 2018. Posted 9 April 2018.<br /><br />
QDM defines Condition/Diagnosis/Problem as a practitioner’s identification of a patient’s disease, illness, injury, or condition. This category contains a single datatype to represent all of these concepts: Diagnosis. A practitioner determines the diagnosis by means of examination, diagnostic test results, patient history, and/or family history. Diagnoses are usually considered unfavorable, but may also represent neutral or favorable conditions that affect a patient’s plan of care (e.g., pregnancy).

<td>FHIR provenance addressed author time, Condition.assertedDate may be closer to the onset of the QDM Prevalence Period. Consider - the software may default assertedDate to the date entered requiring manual editing to enter a different date. Further, does it reflect the date the assertion is made or the date the patient asserted that the condition began? Seeking guidance - due to potential ambiguity, should QDM map to FHIR provenance?</td>
