<p>QDM defines Substance as a homogeneous material with definite composition that includes allergens, biological materials, chemicals, foods, drugs and materials.  QDM distinguishes between medications from non-medication substances by separately listing medication datatypes. Substance may or may not have a code or be classified by a code system such RxNorm. Examples of a substance may include environmental agents (e.g., pollen, dust) and food (e.g., vitamins). QDM defines three contexts for Substance: Substance, Administered; Substance, Order; Substance, Recommended. Since QDM addresses substance a something that is administered, ordered or recommended, the actions are analogous to medications. Hence, the QDM category Substance is mapped to QI core Medication concepts.<br /><br />
The mapping was first uploaded to the wiki on April 3, 2018. The CQI Workgroup reviewed the content on 13 April and required additional review and consideration. A QI Core ballot item from the January ballot suggested that NutritionOrder be included in QI Core. The context might be consistent with Substance, Order and/or Substance, Recommended, however, there are some gaps and the NutritionOrder is specifically focused on different diet types (i.e., enteral diet, supplement usage and parenteral diets) rather than specific dietary substance use. Therefore, the following QDM Substance category items address substance similar to medications OR procedures. The NutritionOrder references, created on 17 April 2018 content were added as considerations for future evaluation once the FHRI resources mature. Similarly, use of Substance for blood product orders and administration provide considerations for future evaluation as well. <br /><br />
<b><i>Use of MedicationAdministration and Procedure FHIR Resources to reference QDM Substance datatypes</i></b><br />
The current mapping reflects additional considerations in that NutritionOrder and Administration of blood products are not yet mature concepts in FHIR 3.0. The potential mapping considerations remain as points for review and discussion. However, the near-term mapping references for Substance, Administration, Substance, Order and Substance, Recommended for instances inconsistent with the Medication resources should use the QDM datatypes Procedure, Performed; Procedure, Order and Procedure, Recommended.<br />
Instances inconsistent with the Medication resources include the following two use cases:<br />
</p>
<ul>


<li>Determination that blood products (a biological product in FHIR resources) are ordered or are administered within specific time relationships to other data elements</li>

<li>Determination that human breast milk (not considered a biological product in the FHIR resource discussions) is used exclusively to feed newborn infants during the initial stay in the hospital after birth.<br /></li>

</ul>
<p>This section was updated on 24 April 2018.<br /><br />
<b><i>Nutrition [Considerations for Future Use]</i></b><br />
The nutrition mappings remain for discussion and review as related FHIR resources become more mature.<br />
Note the reference in <a class="external text" href="http://hl7.org/fhir/nutritionorder.html" rel="nofollow">FHIR NutritionOrder Resource</a>:<br />
The Nutrition Order is a record of the request for the supply of a diet, oral supplement or enteral formulas for a patient. However, to initiate the request requires the use of the Task resource and its associated workflow with the Nutrition Order referenced from Task.basedOn, or by using the Nutrition Task resource in the context of a messaging or service workflow where the request is explicit or implicit.<br />
Based on the quoted reference, Substance is modeled as either medication or nutrition. The NutritionOrder resource is used for requesting oral diets, oral nutrition supplements and enteral feedings in an in-patient setting. The MedicationRequest resource should be used for requesting parenteral (IV) nutrition and prescribing dietary supplements such as vitamin or mineral supplements.<br />
FHIR Tracker Items <a class="external text" href="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;#38;tracker_item_id=15942" rel="nofollow">15942</a> and <a class="external text" href="https://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;#38;tracker_item_id=15943" rel="nofollow">15943</a> address these concerns in current FHIR modeling.<br /><br />
<b><i>Blood Products  [Considerations for Future Use]</i></b><br />
The blood product mappings remain for discussion and review as related FHIR resources become more mature.<br />
Also note a different mapping for blood products addressing SupplyRequest, SupplyDelivery and BiologicallyDerivedProducts.<br />
