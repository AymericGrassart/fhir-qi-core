<p>The CQI Workgroup reviewed this page in April 2018 consistent with QDM version 5.3. QDM version 5.4 updates were applied on June 7, 2018:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Removal of &#34;anatomical approach site&#34; from &#34;Procedure, Performed&#34;, &#34;Procedure, Order&#34;, and &#34;Procedure, Recommended&#34;</li>
    <li>Removal of &#34;method&#34; from &#34;Procedure, Order&#34; and &#34;Procedure, Recommended&#34;</li>
</ul>
<pre>Note that while the QDM categories Intervention and Procedure are modeled identically and interoperability standards do not differentiate between them, both are retained in the QDM as they are more clinically expressive for clinicians to understand the measure intent.
</pre>
<p>QDM defines Procedure as “An Act whose immediate and primary outcome (post-condition) is the alteration of the physical condition of the subject. … Procedure is but one among several types of clinical activities such as observation, substance-administrations, and communicative interactions … Procedure does not comprise all acts of [sic] whose intent is intervention or treatment.”  A procedure may be a surgery or other type of physical manipulation of a person’s body in whole or in part for purposes of making observations and diagnoses or providing treatment.   QDM defines three contexts for Procedure: Procedure, Order; Procedure, Performed; Procedure, Recommended.</p>
<h2>Procedure Priority</h2>
<p>QDM 5.5 includes a new attribute for Procedure: <em>priority</em> with the following definition:</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Priority indicates the urgency of the procedure or the encounter referenced.
        In [electronic clinical quality measures] (eCQMs) the priority attribute will help specify elective from urgent encounters (e.g., hospital admissions) or procedures.
        Priority is a codable concept (i.e., may use a direct reference code or a value set).
        For example, priority is used to express an elective procedure or encounter from an emergency procedure or encounter.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    As noted in the QDM to QI-Core Mapping for Encounter-Related Diagnoses and Procedures, a specific measure may have interest in evaluating care provided for elective procedures (e.g., hip surgery due to osteoarthritis) while excluding emergency, non-planned procedures (e.g., hip surgery due to acute fracture).
    The procedure code does not necessarily allow differentiation of the two concepts.
    A ServiceRequest.priority does have the ability to differentiate the urgency with which the <em>request</em> (or order) should be fulfilled.
    However, there is no element within the FHIR Procedure resource to address the issue.
    Encounter.priority allows specification of whether the encounter is elective.
    An encounter with Encounter.priority = <em>elective</em> <u>and </u>an Encounter.procedure.rank = 1 addresses the need to specify an elective encounter with a principal procedure.
    Therefore, based on the current use case QI-Core has not added an extension to address Procedure.priority and, as a result, there is no direct mapping from the QDM Procedure priority attribute to QI-Core.
